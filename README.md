# AirQuality_Timeseries_ML
The airquality dataset contains PM 2.5 and PM 10 data collected by 2 sensors, site/location and the respective timestamp. 
PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers while PM10 refers to that of less than 10 micrometers. 
The meta data contains longitude & latitude data and location (county, subcouty, district) of the sites from which airquality was measured. 

Problem: Analyse this data and use your machine learning skills & knowledge to generate forecasts for the next 24 hours at each respective hour of the day.
